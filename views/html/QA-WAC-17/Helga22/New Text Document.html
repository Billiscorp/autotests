According to the object of testing:
</h2>

<p>
*Functional testing *- testing based on an analysis of the specification of a component or system functionality.
</p>
<p>
*Load testing * - it is the definition of speed of operation application under different loads. During this test, a check instruction execution time, the number of users can work simultaneously with the program, the definition of the boundaries of performance with increasing load on application performance analysis at high limit and stress loads.
</p>
<p>
Testing usability (Usability testing) - testing to determine the degree of comprehensibility, ease of learning and use, the software more attractive to the user when used in the specified operating conditions.
</p>
<p>
*Test User interface *- requires verification of compliance requirements of the application to the graphical interface, whether it is professional looking, whether it is done in the same style.
</p>
Security testing - is a testing strategy that is used to check the security of the system, as well as to analyze the risks associated with providing a holistic approach to the protection of applications, hackers, viruses, unauthorized access to confidential data.
*Testing localization * - is the process of testing the localized version of the software. Checking the accuracy of the translation of user interface elements, verification of the correctness of the translation system messages and error checking the translation of "Help" / "Help" and the accompanying documentation.
*Testing Compatibility * - type of non-functional testing, the main aim of which is to verify the correct operation of the product in a particular environment (hardware platform, network devices, peripherals (printers, CD / DVD-drives, webcams, etc.), operating system. databases, browsers, etc.).
*Performance Testing * - the process of testing to determine the performance of a software product.
stability testing and reliability (Stability / Reliability Testing) - a type of software testing, the purpose of which is to test application performance in long-term tests with the average (expected) load level.
** Stress testing **- it is automated testing, simulating the work of a certain number of business users on any or general (shared by them) resource.
*Testing the installation (Installation Testing) * - installation testing aimed at verifying the successful installation and configuration, as well as upgrade or uninstall the software.
*Static testing *- testing of a component or system at specification or implementation without execution of software code, such as reviewing or static analysis.
Dynamic testing - testing conducted during the execution of the software component or system.

According to the knowledge of the system:
</h2>

*White box testing * - testing based on an analysis of the internal structure of a component or system.
** Black box testing** - testing, functional or non-functional, without any knowledge of the internal structure of a component or system.
*Testing by the gray box (Grey box testing) *- a combination of tests of "black" and "white-box". It is understood that the tester looks for the product and the end user, and checks the code, if necessary.</li>
